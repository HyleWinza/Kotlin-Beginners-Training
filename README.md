## Android Development with Kotlin Examples
This repository includes some of examples that we did in our *Basic Kotlin* Course and the subsequent *Android Development with Kotlin*. This repository will be updated regularly as the course is ongoing.

To be able to Use these examples, you need Kotlin compiler and Editor for Kotlin examples.  Please [see Kotlin Reference](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html) for more details.

For Android Examples you will need Android Studio. Please change your gradle.build file to match your SDK build tools.
